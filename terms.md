3. Platform Provider Rules

In the event that you are using the Service through a third-party website or application, social network, platform or store ("Platform"), you must comply with the terms of use or services of such Platform (the "Platform Terms"), in addition to these Terms, and the Platform's privacy policy will apply to any of your interactions with the Platform. The Platform Terms are incorporated into these Terms by reference such that a violation by you of the Platform Terms shall be deemed a violation of these Terms. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and the Platform Terms, the Platform Terms shall control solely to the extent the conflict relates to the rights or obligations of the Platform and not of us.

If you have downloaded the Service from the Apple, Inc. ("Apple"), App Store or if you are using the Service on an iOS device, you acknowledge that you have read, understood and agree to the following notice regarding Apple. This Agreement is between you and Moon Active only, not with Apple, and Apple is not responsible for the Service and the content thereof. Apple has no obligation whatever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Service. In the event of any failure of the Service to conform to any applicable warranty, then you may notify Apple and Apple will refund any applicable purchase price for the App to you. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple has no other warranty obligation whatever with respect to the Service. Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims by you or any third party relating to the Service or your possession or use of the Service, including: (1) product liability claims; (2) any claim that the Service fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (3) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation. Apple is not responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any third-party claim that the Service infringes that third party's intellectual property rights. You agree to comply with any applicable third-party terms, when using the Service. Apple, and Apple's subsidiaries, are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement, and upon your acceptance of this Agreement, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement against you as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement. You hereby represent and warrant that (1) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a "terrorist supporting" country; and (2) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.

4. Virtual Items and Game Play

In the course of using the Service you may win, earn or alternatively purchase, with real-world money, certain game credits or prizes, virtual play money coins, tokens, points and virtual in-game items ("Virtual Items").

You are not obligated, at any time, to purchase any Virtual Items.  You understand that you have no right or title in the Virtual Items appearing or originating in any Game, whether "earned" in a game or "purchased", or in any other attributes associated with an Account or stored on the Service. Virtual Items are licensed to you by us for your personal use in the game. You may not purchase or sell Virtual Items outside the Service, or attempt to sell in the "real world" anything that appears or originates in the Service at any time. Any such attempted sale shall be null and void and may result in termination of your Account and legal action taken against you. You may trade Virtual Items within a Game, but only where expressly permitted by Game rules and never for any real-money consideration. Other than a limited, personal, revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicenseable license to use the Virtual Items with the Service, you have no right or title in or to any such Virtual Items. We retain the right to manage, regulate, control, modify and delete Virtual Items at our sole discretion, and we shall have no liability to you or anyone for the exercise of such rights. We may selectively remove or revoke your license to use or associate Virtual Items with your Account without notice at our sole discretion. Prices and availability of Virtual Items are subject to change without notice.

Virtual Items may only be held by legal residents of jurisdictions where access to and use of the Games are permitted. Virtual Items may only be purchased or acquired from us through our Web Store or through the applicable Platform (such as Google Play Store or Apple App Store). We reserve the right to refuse your request to purchase or acquire Virtual Items for any reason. When you purchase Virtual Items, they will reside in your Account until discharged through use of the Service, unless removed or revoked by us.

Depending on your Platform, any Virtual Item purchased from your Platform will be subject to its terms and conditions and user agreement of such Platform. Usage rights for each purchase may differ from item to item. If you are unsure about usage rights you should check with your Platform before making a purchase.

When purchasing Virtual Items, you agree to pay the applicable charges for your purchase, including applicable taxes, through the applicable store. If your transaction with our payment processing partners is not successful then your purchase will not be fulfilled. Upon the completion of a successful payment transaction then your purchase will be fulfilled to you as soon as possible – we will endeavor to fulfill your order immediately at the point of purchase.

If you do not connect the Games on a device to your Account (directly or through your social network account), then we will not be able to restore any Virtual Items (whether purchased by, or otherwise credited or awarded to you) or other data associated with your Game play to a different device (including if you lose that device or it is damaged). We will not be liable for any loss or deletion of Virtual Items, whether purchased by you or granted by us without making a purchase, or of any data associated with your play of the Games, from a device not connected to an account.

5. Refunds for Purchases of Virtual Items and Billing Discrepancies

Purchases of Virtual Items are final and are not refundable, transferable or exchangeable unless stated otherwise at our discretion.  Requests for refunds should be made to the Platform through which they were purchased or, if made through our Web Store, to info@moonactive.com.

Purchases made through a Platform are additionally subject to Platform rules governing refunds and returns. 

For purchases through our Web Store Only: Residents of the European Economic Area, United Kingdom and Switzerland who make purchases through our Web Store may seek refunds for up to fourteen (14) days after purchase, but only in case none of the Virtual Items purchased in the relevant transaction have been used in the relevant Game and only if they discontinue all play of the relevant Game from the purchase of the relevant Virtual Item until the refund request has been processed.  We will process the refund request as expeditiously as we are reasonably able.

You agree to notify us about any billing problems or discrepancies within 30 days from the date of your purchase. If you do not bring them to our attention within 30 days, you agree that you waive your right to dispute such problems or discrepancies. You are responsible for and agree to reimburse us for all reversals, charge-backs, claims, fees, fines, penalties and any other liability incurred by us (including costs and related expenses) that were caused by or arising out of payments that you authorized or accepted or that were authorized or accepted using your Login Information (even if not authorized by you). You understand that we may suspend or terminate your Account if for any reason a charge that you authorized or that was authorized using your Login Information cannot be processed or is returned or unpaid, and if such event occurs, you shall immediately remit to us payment for such charge through any payment method. In the event your Login Information has been compromised, please notify us immediately and we will use commercially reasonable efforts to reverse any unauthorized charges. If the compromise results from our negligence or breach of these Terms, then we will reimburse you for any resulting loss, provided that you have timely notified us (as required by this paragraph) of the charge.

In the event of what we determine in our sole discretion to be fraudulent or suspicious purchases, or an excessive number of reversals, charge-backs or disputes, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to Web Store, in addition to any other rights and remedies we may possess under these Terms.

6. Rewards

Virtual Items that you are awarded without purchase (“Rewards”) will expire if not collected within 7 days. Rewards are generally collected automatically once awarded unless the User stops collection from occurring. If any special or affirmative action is required to collect a Reward, the User will be so advised.

7. Subscription Services

Certain Games may be offered on a subscription basis. You will be advised of the price, duration and all applicable terms before purchase. You will be notified prior to any renewal of the amount and date of the upcoming renewal payment both within the relevant Game and at the email you maintain as part of your Account information. You can cancel your subscription by following the instructions within the Game. Unless otherwise stated, cancelations will take effect at the end of the then-current term.

20. Governing Law and Judicial Forum

These Terms, your use of the Service and our entire relationship will be interpreted in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Israel without regard to conflict- or choice-of-law principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is specifically excluded. If your Country of Residence (as defined below) is the United States the agreement to arbitrate contained in Section 21, its scope and its enforcement shall also be governed by the United States Federal Arbitration Act without regard to conflict- or choice-of-law principles.

In the event that you have opted out of arbitration (as set out below) or that the agreement to arbitrate is otherwise found not to apply to you or your claim, you and Moon Active agree that any judicial proceeding (other than as described above) may only be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in Tel Aviv-Jaffa, Israel. Both you and Moon Active consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you and Moon Active may bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction (i) to compel arbitration pursuant to Section 21 below, (ii) to enforce an arbitral award issued thereunder, or (iii) for temporary injunctive relief pursuant to Section 21(h).

21. Dispute Resolution and Agreement to Arbitrate on an Individual Basis

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION 21 CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU AND MOON ACTIVE TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU AND MOON ACTIVE CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM EACH OTHER.

By agreeing to these Terms, you and Moon Active agree that any and all past, present and future disputes, claims or causes of action between you and Moon Active arising out of or relating to these Terms, the Service, the formation of these Terms or any other dispute between you and Moon Active or any of Moon Active's licensors, distributors, suppliers or agents (including but not limited to any application store or platform from which the Service is accessed or downloaded), and whether arising prior to or after your agreement to this Section 21, (collectively, “Dispute(s)”) will be governed by the procedure outlined below.  You and Moon Active further agree that any arbitration pursuant to this Section 21 shall not proceed as a class, group or representative action.

“Country of Residence” for purposes of this Section 21 means the country in which you hold citizenship or legal permanent residence, as well as any country from which you regularly access and use the Service.  If more than one country meets that definition for you, then your country of citizenship or legal permanent residence shall be your Country of Residence, and if you have more than one country of citizenship or legal permanent residence, it shall be the country with which you most closely are associated by permanent or most frequent residence.

If your Country of Residence is in the European Economic Area, no provision in this Section 21 shall exclude or restrict any of your statutory rights you may have as a consumer.

(a)      Informal Dispute Resolution.  Moon Active wants to address your concerns without the need for a formal legal dispute.  Before filing a claim against Moon Active, you agree to try to resolve the Dispute informally by contacting info@moonactive.com.  Similarly, Moon Active will undertake reasonable efforts to contact you (if we have e-mail or similar contact information for you) to resolve any claim we may wish to assert informally before taking any formal action. If a dispute is not resolved within 30 days after the email noting the Dispute is sent, you or Moon Active may initiate an arbitration proceeding as described below.

(b)        We Both Agree To Arbitrate.  By agreeing to these Terms, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, you and Moon Active each and both agree to resolve any Disputes – including any Dispute concerning the enforceability, validity, scope or severability of this agreement to arbitrate – through final and binding arbitration as discussed herein.

(c)       Opt-out of Agreement to Arbitrate.  You may decline this agreement to arbitrate by contacting info@moonactive.com within 30 days of first accepting these Terms and stating that you (include your first and last name, email address and postal address) decline this arbitration agreement.  By opting out of the agreement to arbitrate, you will not be precluded from using the Service, but you and Moon Active will not permitted to invoke the mutual agreement to arbitrate to resolve Disputes under the Terms otherwise provided herein.

(d)        Arbitration Procedures and Fees.

(d.1)  If your Country of Residence is the United States, you and Moon Active agree that JAMS ("JAMS") will administer the arbitration under its Streamlined Rules in effect at the time arbitration is sought ("JAMS Rules"). Those rules are available at www.jamsadr.com. Arbitration will proceed on an individual basis and will be handled by a sole arbitrator in accordance with those rules; provided that the parties shall be presented with a list of five potential arbitrators and shall rank those potential arbitrators in order of preference. JAMS shall select the arbitrator with the highest combined preference (e.g., if both parties select a potential arbitrator as their top preference, that arbitrator will be selected). You and Moon Active further agree that, unless and only to the extent prohibited under JAMS Rules, the arbitration will be held in New York, New York, or, at either your or our election, will be conducted telephonically or via other remote electronic means. The JAMS Rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. The arbitrator shall be authorized to award any remedies, including injunctive relief, that would be available to you in an individual lawsuit and that are not waivable under applicable law. Except as and to the extent otherwise may be required or expressly permitted by law, the arbitration proceeding and any award shall be confidential.

(d.2) If your Country of Residence is not the United States, you and Moon Active agree that the Center of Arbitration and Dispute Resolution (www.israelcourts.co.il (“CADR”) will administer the arbitration, which shall be conducted in accordance with its rules in effect at the time arbitration is sought, and in accordance with the Israeli Arbitration Law, 5728-1968, as amended. Arbitration will proceed on an individual basis and will be handled by a sole arbitrator in accordance with those rules.  You and Moon Active further agree that the arbitration will be held in English and in Tel Aviv-Jaffa (Israel), or, if you so elect, all proceedings can be conducted telephonically or via other remote electronic means.  The CADR rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees.  Except as and to the extent otherwise may be required or expressly permitted by law, the arbitration proceeding and any award shall be confidential.

 (e)       Proceedings Requiring Three Arbitrators. Notwithstanding any language to the contrary in Section 21(e), if a party either seeks a monetary award in excess of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) or seeks an equitable form of relief that would significantly impact other Moon Active users, in each case as reasonably determined by either party, the parties agree that such arbitration will proceed on an individual basis but will be handled by a panel of three (3) arbitrators and take place pursuant to the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“JAMS Comprehensive Rules”). Each party shall select one neutral arbitrator, with the third neutral arbitrator selected in accordance with the JAMS Comprehensive Rules. That third arbitrator shall serve as chair of the arbitral panel and must be a retired judge with experience arbitrating or mediating disputes. In the event of disagreement as to whether the threshold for a three-arbitrator panel has been met, the sole arbitrator appointed in accordance with Section 21(e.1) shall make that determination. If the arbitrator determines a three-person panel is appropriate, the arbitrator may – if selected by either party or through the JAMS selection process – participate in the arbitral panel. You and Moon Active agree that any award issued by a three-arbitrator panel may be appealed in accordance with the JAMS Optional Arbitration Appeal Procedures at either party’s election.

 (f)       Batch Arbitration. To increase efficiency of resolution, in the event 25 or more similar arbitration demands against Moon Active, presented by or with the assistance of the same law firm or organization or group of law firms or organizations acting together, are submitted to JAMS in accordance with the rules described above within a 30-day period, JAMS shall consolidate those arbitrations as contemplated in the JAMS Rules by (a) grouping the arbitration demands into batches of no more than 25 demands per batch (plus, to the extent there are fewer than 25 arbitration demands left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining demands); and (b) providing for resolution of each batch as a single arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees and one arbitrator assigned per batch. For avoidance of doubt, consolidation does not require that all arbitrations in a single batch be decided the same, nor does it impair your right to present any evidence or argument that you think particular to your case, so long as consistent with JAMS Rules. You agree to cooperate in good faith with Moon Active and JAMS to implement such a batch approach to resolution and fees.

(g)       Class Action and Collective Arbitration Waiver. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER YOU NOR MOON ACTIVE SHALL BE ENTITLED TO CONSOLIDATE, JOIN OR COORDINATE DISPUTES BY OR AGAINST OTHER INDIVIDUALS OR ENTITIES; TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY GROUP, CLASS, COLLECTIVE OR MASS ARBITRATION OR LITIGATION; TO ARBITRATE OR LITIGATE ANY DISPUTE IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, INCLUDING AS A REPRESENTATIVE MEMBER OF A CLASS; TO ARBITRATE OR LITIGATE ANY DISPUTE IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY; OR OTHERWISE TO SEEK TO RECOVER LOSSES OR DAMAGES (WHETHER FOR YOURSELF OR OTHERS) INCURRED BY A THIRD PARTY. IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DISPUTE (AS DEFINED ABOVE), ANY AND ALL SUCH RIGHTS ARE HEREBY EXPRESSLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVED. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY SET FORTH IN THESE TERMS, IN THE EVENT ALL OR ANY PORTION OF SUBSECTIONS (e), (f) OR (g) OF THIS SECTION 21 (CLASS ACTION AND COLLECTIVE ARBITRATION WAIVER) ARE FOUND TO BE INVALID OR LESS THAN FULLY ENFORCEABLE IN A PARTICULAR DISPUTE, THEN THE ENTIRETY OF THIS SECTION 21 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS) MAY BE DEEMED VOID AND AS HAVING NO EFFECT FOR PURPOSES OF THAT DISPUTE, UPON EITHER PARTY’S ELECTION.

(h)        Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate for Temporary Relief.  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 21 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS), either you or Moon Active may bring an action in a court authorized by Section 20 for temporary injunctive relief until an arbitrator has been empaneled and can determine whether to continue, terminate or modify such relief.  Additionally:

(h.1)  If your Country of Residence is the United Kingdom or in the European Economic Area, notwithstanding your and Moon Active’s agreement to arbitrate Disputes, either you or Moon Active also may assert claims, if they qualify, through the small claims process in the courts of your Country of Residence. If your Country of Residence is in the European Economic Area, you may also seek to use the Online Dispute Resolution platform offered by the European Commission https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/ . Please note that Moon Active shall not be required to use this or any other alternative dispute resolution platform.

(h.2) If your Country of Residence is not the United States, the United Kingdom or in the European Economic Area, notwithstanding your and Moon Active’s agreement to arbitrate Disputes, either you or Moon Active may also assert claims, if they qualify, through the Small Claims Court in Tel Aviv-Jaffa, Israel, or if a court in your Country of Residence would not recognize such a requirement (notwithstanding the provisions of this Section), then in a small claims court or the equivalent in your Country of Residence.
